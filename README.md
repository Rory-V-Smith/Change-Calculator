# Change-Calculator
A programme that implements a Greedy algorithm that calculates the minimum number of coins required to give a user change, per the below.
```
$ python cash.py
Change owed: 0.41
4
```

### Background
When making change, odds are you want to minimize the number of coins you’re dispensing for each customer, lest you run out (or annoy the customer!). Fortunately, computer science has given cashiers everywhere ways to minimize numbers of coins due: greedy algorithms.
According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), a greedy algorithm is one “that always takes the best immediate, or local, solution while finding an answer. Greedy algorithms find the overall, or globally, optimal solution for some optimization problems, but may find less-than-optimal solutions for some instances of other problems.

This programme implements a Greedy algorithm to calculate the minimum number of coins required to give a user change.
